- 👋 Hi, I’m Alberto Rodriguez.
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend web-development, and also in all the creative possibilities it opens for communication sciences.
- 🌱 After learning advanced vanilla JavaScript, now I'm learning its libraries, React/NextJS being the first one (yes, I know, for newbies this is almost a cliche) but also interested in creative JS such as Gsap and ThreeJS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can help while learning.
- 📫 How to reach me you can email me at alrodriguezgar14@gmail.com
