- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlRodriguezGar14
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development, and also in all the creative possibilities it opens for communication sciences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vanilla JavaScript in order to master its use and libraries such as React (yes, I know, for newbies this is almost a cliche), SolidJS, and Svelte. I'm also interested in Remix for Blockchain; because why not.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can help while learning.
- 📫 How to reach me you can email me at alrodriguezgar14@gmail.com
